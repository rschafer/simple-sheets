# Rules Directory

Established knowledge that applies across sessions. Create domain-specific files as needed.

## When to Create a New Rule File

Create a new `<domain>.md` file when you have 3+ related pieces of established knowledge about:
- An API or external service
- A codebase pattern or convention
- A data source or integration
- Architecture decisions

## Example Rule Files

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `api.md` | API endpoints, auth patterns, rate limits |
| `database.md` | Schema conventions, query patterns, migrations |
| `testing.md` | Test setup, fixtures, mocking patterns |
| `deployment.md` | Deploy commands, env vars, infrastructure |
